I’d like you to prepare an in-depth due diligence report on [Company Name / Ticker Symbol] focusing specifically on its fundamental business quality, rather than just the financial metrics. Please cover the following areas in detail:

Business Model & Value Proposition

What does the company actually do?

What problem does it solve and for whom?

How does it make money, and how durable is this model?

Products & Services

Core offerings and any diversification.

Product/service lifecycle — how innovative or defensible are they?

Customer base: Who are the main customers, and how sticky are they?

Industry & Competitive Position

Overview of the industry’s structure and trends.

The company’s market share and position.

Key competitive advantages or “moat” (brand, technology, network effects, cost leadership, etc.).

Threats from new entrants, substitutes, or disruptive technologies.

Management & Culture

Who are the key leaders and what is their track record?

Company culture and reputation (for innovation, ethics, treatment of employees, etc.).

Any succession planning issues or risks?

Business Risks & Challenges

Major operational, regulatory, or reputational risks.

Known challenges the company is facing (supply chain, competitive pressures, dependence on key markets or customers, etc.).

How adaptable is the company to industry changes?

Growth Drivers & Long-Term Outlook

What organic or inorganic growth opportunities exist?

How sustainable is its competitive advantage?

Any notable trends that could benefit or threaten the business in the long run?

ESG & Reputation

Environmental, social, and governance considerations.

Any controversies, lawsuits, or ethical concerns?

Public perception and brand strength.

Deliverables:

A clear, balanced narrative highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and key unknowns.

Credible sources or examples to support any claims.

Your own thoughts on whether this is fundamentally a good business to hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations.

Tone: Please make it clear, honest, and practical — focus on qualitative insights, not just surface-level descriptions. Feel free to add any other angles you think are relevant.

Let me know if you’d like me to clarify my goals further.

Thanks!"
